               Why stash your old clothes, shirts and pants in a drawer when they could be help underprivileged people?
               <br />
               <br />
               While our NGO partners are offering services to serve clothes to needy people.
               <br />
               <br />
               On the other side, millions of clothes are thrown into trash—even more are hiding away in store rooms. Give your clothes new life and help people.
